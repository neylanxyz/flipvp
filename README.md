# FLiPvP
A project made for Pharos Builder Base Camp hackathon.

*Overall*

FLiPvP is a decentralized 1v1 Coin Flip game. Players can compete against each other without relying on any third party, such as a casino. All randomness is derived from player interaction and on-chain data.

*How to play*

Pick your side — Heads or Tails. When two different players choose opposing sides, they are matched into a game.

Once both players have placed their bets, the result is instantly generated and the winner is revealed. The winner receives approximately 1.93× their bet, with a 7% service fee deducted.

If one player (let's say Player 1) places a bet but no opponent joins within 3 minutes, Player 1 is eligible for a refund.

The game concludes immediately when both players have placed their bets.

*Conclusion*

This is a proof of concept for a project I'm developing. I'm working on launching a Web3 SDK - a 1v1 game engine that allows other developers to build decentralized PvP games and publish them on a shared platform.
