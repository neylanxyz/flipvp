            <h1>Basics</h1>
        </div>
        <p>FLiPvP is a decentralized 1v1 Coin Flip game. Players can compete against each other without relying on any third party, such as a casino. All randomness is derived from player interaction and on-chain data.</p>

            <h1>How to Play</h1>
        </div>
        <p>Pick your side — Heads or Tails. When two different players choose opposing sides, they are matched into a game.</p>
        <p>Once both players have placed their bets, the result is instantly generated and the winner is revealed. The winner receives approximately 1.93× their bet, with a 7% service fee deducted.</p>
        <p>If one player (let's say Player 1) places a bet but no opponent joins within 3 minutes, Player 1 is eligible for a refund.</p>
        <p>The game concludes immediately when both players have placed their bets.</p>

            <h1>Dev</h1>
        </div>
        <p>This is a proof of concept for a project I'm developing. I'm working on launching a Web3 SDK — a 1v1 game engine that allows other developers to build decentralized PvP games and publish them on a shared platform.</p>
